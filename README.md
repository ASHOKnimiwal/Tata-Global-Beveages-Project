# Tata Global Beverages Stock Prediction

Introduction

Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

Can we use machine learning as a tool to our advantage in this domain? Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to capture and pull out the patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make accurate predictions.

In this repository I used several machine learning techniques for predicting the future stock price of a company by using historical data about the stock prices of the company. The core idea behind this repository is to showcase how the time-series models like ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM(sequence model) are implemented.
