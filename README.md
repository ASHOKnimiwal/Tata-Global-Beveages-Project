# New-Germany Fund Stock Prediction

Introduction

Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – 
physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very 
difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

Can we use machine learning as a game changer in this domain? Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their 
quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and 
these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

This repository is about predicting the future stock price of a company by using historical data about the stock prices of the company. The core idea behind this repository is to showcase how the ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM algorithms are implemented.
