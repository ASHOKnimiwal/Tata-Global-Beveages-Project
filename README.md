# New-Germany Fund Stock Prediction

Introduction

The data is a sample from the historical US stock prices in the last 5 years. Only the New German Fund (GF) will be considered 
for analysis.
Whether we wish to predict the trend in financial markets or electricity consumption, time is an important factor that must now 
be considered in our models. For example, it would be interesting to forecast at what hour during the day is there going to be a 
peak consumption in electricity, such as to adjust the price or the production of electricity.

Enter time series. A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the 
independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.

However, there are other aspects that come into play when dealing with time series.

Is it stationary?

Is there a seasonality?

Is the target variable autocorrelated?

In this project, I implemented some common techniques to manipulate time series and make predictions.
